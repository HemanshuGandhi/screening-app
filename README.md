## Brief History
The app was inherited from [another screening project](https://github.com/andrelim435/i2emr). 
The previous developer was relatively new to Web Development + the development timeline for the previous project was quite tight so some implementations are not robust.

The timeline for PHS 2019 was also quite tight so most of the efforts were spent customising forms. A few enhancements were made but there is still room for improvement in terms of the overall structure.
